## Velocity equations

- v = u + at
- s = ut + 1/2at^2
- s = 1/2(u + v)t
- v^2 = u^2 + 2as

## Force equations

- F = ma
- Up thrust = mass of liquid displaced x Acceleration due to gravity
- Up thrust = volume of liquid displaced x density of liquid displaced x Acceleration due to gravity
- Frictional force = coefficient of friction x force

## Energy equations

- Kinetic energy = Â½ x m x v2
- Potential energy = m x g x h
- P = F x v
- W = F x d

## Electricity equations

- Power = voltage x current
- Voltage = current x resistance
- Charge = current x time
- Energy = voltage x charge
- Energy = voltage x current x time
